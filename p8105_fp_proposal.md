The tentative project title:

The motivation for this project: We are curious about the implications
of self-identified race and personality type to game show survival, as
entertainment culture is deeply intertwined with societal biases.

The intended final products:

Our anticipated data sources are the `castaway_details` and `castaways`
datasets from the `survivoR` package, which has data from all seasons of
the U.S. T.V. show Survivor.

The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges: In order to
gather sufficient data, we plan to combine several data sets (including
`castaway_details` and `castaways`) and tidy them if necessary. Some of
our variables of interest have many categories, which could lead to loss
of generality. To combat this, we may categorize our variables of
interest differently, such as extracting whether a person is an
introvert or extrovert from their personality type, or using a POC
indicator variable instead of individual races. We plan to perform EDA
that visualize the distributions of our variables of interest, including
POC, race, ethnicity, gender, personality type, and age. As our main
analysis, we plan on doing survival analysis, using the number of days
the contestants stay on the show.

The planned timeline:
